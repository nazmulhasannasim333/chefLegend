                  In react JS Controlled components refer to components that
                  have their state and behavior controlled by the parent
                  component. These components rely on props passed down from the
                  parent component to update their state and behavior.
                  Uncontrolled components refer to components that manage their
                  own state internally.

                <p>
                  We validate them by setting the propTypes property of the
                  component to an object that has the names of the props to
                  validate as the keys. And the corresponding values are the
                  data type of the props.
